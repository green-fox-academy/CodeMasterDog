// Create 3 constructors for them:
// One empty which sets the member varibale to 0;
// A copy constructor, that takes an Integer& argument
// A third one which takes an int as argument and makes the member variable equal to the int it took.
//
// Write code that uses these and prints out the value of the member variable of the integers created.
// (You will have to create a get method to do this appropriately.)

/*
 * array_function-01.c
 * Create a function that takes an array as argument and it's length. Determine the right data types to do this.
 * This function should order the arguments in ascending order and return this in a new sorted array.
 *
 * Create a second function that takes 3 arguments. An array, it's length and a number it is searching for.
 * The function should return the index of the number when found or -1 if it's not part of the array.
 * IMPORTANT: this function expects a sorted array and uses the strategy we used when we play guess the number.
 *
 *
 * In the main function create an unsorted array filled with random numbers, Make it 50 long.
 * Try 2 scenarios:
 *    * In the first: You pick a random element in the unosrted array and check at which index it is after the array is sorted.
 *    * In the second: You pick a number You are sure is not in the array. Check whether the search function returns the right number.
 * Print out what You need to check these.
